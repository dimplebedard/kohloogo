                            <p>That was a golden age for the Bugei in Brazil, where countless opportunities emerged from meetings and festivities, which enabled an exchange of knowledge and led to a restructuring of what we call Kaze no Ryu Bugei. Perhaps it would be more correct to call it Kaze no Ryu Ogawa Ha, although that may not be supported by older practitioners. With Explanation Private class with Shidoshi Jordan Training moments under Shidoshi Jordan’s guidance and instruction.

Yes, I'm aware of some of the controversy surrounding Ogawa Ryu. But I still like the way these guys have put Judo (and let's be honest.the "base" here definitely tastes of judo) with their other stuff https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4xioknKLZo. Ogawa Ryu ? Non-Aikido Martial Traditions. I could be wrong, but I'm with Neil. Yes, it's done better than the usual slap-dash conglomeration of fake koryu, but some things about the info provided and the techniques displayed raised red flags.

Traditional Ju Jutsu of the Ogawa Ryu. This is a type similar to pre-WWII Judo, when various families of traditional JuJutsu joined the movement started by Jigoro Kano in the foundation of the Kodokan.

In this DVD, Shidoshi Jordan Augusto, whose competence for teaching the tradition of the lineage was recognized by Sensei Ogawa himself, wanted to show the many disciplines that Kobujutsu and Taijutsu cover and which involves: demonstrations of Aikijujutsu (Art of fighting based on harmony and the use of inner energy). As a reply to another thread of mine, /u/GunsmokeG has kindly recommended a Ryu Murakami book to me (Piercing). I have started another one of R. Murakami's works (Coin Locker Babies) and only 5% in, find myself already being deeply sucked into the novel. What talent to draw the reader closer and closer. And all the time you sense something horribly gruesome is going to come up, but you don't know when exactly  so you try to read with certain: caution. But you are curious and intrigued. The Evolution Championship Series. The most famous fighting game tournament in the world. It only happens once a year, or thanks to EVO Japan, twice a year. But even so, Las Vegas is one of the most expensive places to spend a weekend, and their Mandalay Bay is sure to be a hot ticket for Sunday Finals. A ticket you can rushdown with SeatGeek!\~ .

Pro Wrestling NOAH ---------- Website Official Site (www.noah.co.jp) Founded: 2000 Founded by: Mitsuhara Misawa (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuharu_Misawa) Owned by: Former Sumo Wrestler and Professional Wrestler Akira Taue (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Taue) Style: Modified Royal Road (Ark Style) Championship Titles: GHC Heavyweight Championship (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHC_Heavyweight_Championship), GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion. I've read most thrillers by Ryu Murakami, Yoko Ogawa, and Natsuo Kirino. I really enjoyed Koji Suzuki's novels and short stories. Edogawa Rampo is fantastic. Are there any more contemporary Japanese novels that are about the paranormal? I don't like Haruki Murakami, so After I'm looking for good contemporary Japanese Science Fiction novels, translated into English. I've already read All You Need Is Kill. Can anyone recommend any others? These seem to be what Amazon has to offer. Unfortunately all but one are old classics published 30+ years ago. Has anyone read any of these? Usurper of the Sun by Housuke Nojiri ( Yukikaze by Chohei Kambayashi ( The Next Continent by Issui. Murakami Haruki is probably the most widely read current Japanese author. I personally love his work (I've read almost everything. Working my way through 1Q84 at the moment), but I'd also like to help gateway people who aren't that familiar beyond his novels into other Japanese fiction. Here's a short starter suggestion list, all available in English: Yoshimoto Banana - Often seen as quite similar to Murakami, she's also a writer of fiction involving personal connections, self exploration To put into perspective the career of Mitsuharu Misawa, perhaps the best American analogy is not a pro wrestler, like Bret Hart or Shawn Michaels, contemporaries and the two names who may be his closest cultural equivalents in the ring. But neither had his importance overall to the industry because of his role as a promoter and leader, particularly in what figured to be a very rough period for the business. It’s probably race car driver Dale Earnhardt, whose similarities only coincidentally. 0500 - Had a dream of her. Woke up in a daze. Just remember her being mad. Sometimes we're happy, other times she's upset. 1000 - Woken up by Chuck. Well, it's more like he said something so it was time to start the day. He wanted to drive home early because he has to work tomorrow. That and it's a two hour drive. We watched the CVS2 Top 8 archive. RIP PVP, Jason, and Steve. One round losers in CVS2 sucks but for time constraints it makes sense. Wish they made it 2/3 for top 8 at least. </p>
